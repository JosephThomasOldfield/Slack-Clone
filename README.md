# Slack-Clone

This project was a group project in which we used a combination of pair programming, branching, and a very well managed Trello board, in order to work as an effective team. The aim was to recreate slack using everything we have learned about REACT,
Handlebars, Node, and Javascript. 


# How to run?

- npm install (to install moduels) 
- npm start (Hosts on port 3000)


## Tech & Features

- In this app we used React, Node, HTML5, SCSS, and JavaScript logic.
- This application allows communication on multiple channels, displays your name and allows for constant updates without reloading (thanks react). 
- The data on each channel is saved such that you can switcvh between and review previous messages. oOrigionally this was an issue as we used a singular array to store messages but we updated this with a propbs method and navigastion conttroller. 
- The site is dynamic and works on both desktop and mobile without issue. 


## Improvements? 

- Eventually we want to add a full back end to this project such that it can be used or communicartion between 2 devices. 
- The login page can be used however we have not completed the sign up system. This could the nallow for users to sign up and add greater levels of personalisation such as themes. 
- Add a dark mode to make the most of AMOLED screens in many modern mobile devices.
